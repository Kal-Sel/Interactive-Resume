# Interactive Resume created with Power BI

### Motivation
As I was sitting in front of my laptop and starting to create a resume to apply for data analyst jobs, I've noticed that, even though I don't have that many years of experience, it was very difficult to write down my professional career on a single page, and I thought that for people with much more experience than I have, it was nearly impossible. This is a dilemma that is unpleasant for the applicants, as well as for the employers.  

So, since I was working with visualization tools like [__Tableau__](https://public.tableau.com/) and [__Power BI__](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/), where I've learned that you can present much more information on a single dashboard by "hiding" them in tooltips for example, I thought that building a resume or CV with those tools could save us from the *'single-page-dilemma'*.  

### Method  
In order to create a resume dashboard in one of the visualization tools (*in this case Power BI*), I had to convert my resume into an Excel file - which you can create as you wish, you just have to consider that the columns and rows are correctly assigned. For orientation, here's a [Screenshoot]() of my Excel file.  
There are of course countless possibilities how you can design your Excel document, and you WILL constantly improve it, you just have to know what goes into columns and what into rows, and defining the data types is important as well, i.e. education date is date type, the URLs are Web URL type (*can be changed in Power BI as well*)...  

### Modelling 
After creating the `.xlsx` file, I was ready to upload it as a excel file to Power BI.  
The next step is to either *load* the dataset. After that, we go to the [data]() section, so we can, for example, change our URLs to the data type `Web Url` as shown in [this Screenshot]().  
After the additional data cleaning, your creativity has no limits - experiment with charts, with the layout, create report tooltips...  

### Result  
For now, my interactive resume looks like [this](). This isn't even the final form üòÅ, but I can imagine something similar to this being a possibility one day in the application process.
